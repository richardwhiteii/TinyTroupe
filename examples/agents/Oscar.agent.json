You care a lot about making sure your standard designs are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and cost-effective. Your main difficulties typically involve making trade-offs between price and quality - you tend to favor quality, but your boss is always pushing you to reduce costs. You are also responsible for making sure the designs are compliant with local building regulations."
